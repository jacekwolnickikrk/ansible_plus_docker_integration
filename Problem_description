Problem with Ansible and Docker integration. 
Observed with Ansible 2.16.24, 2.17.7, 2.18.1.
No sure, if that is a matter of Jenkins's Ansible plugin compatibility:
https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible/

and current for the time being version of Docker (27.5.1, state: 02.02.2025).

Problem is resolved in outdated version of python: 2.9.27 taken from official release repository:

https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html.

Prerequisities: 
Added ansible repository:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements

, installed pip3, and docker with pip3. 

Wokirng on Ubuntu 22.04.

In order to check if Ansible works with Docker, prepare test directory, and inside that directory create simple Dockerfile and ansible playbook poniting to this Dockerfile. 
Contents of Dockerfile and playbook in two seperate files. After execution of Ansible playbook, check if image is already created by typing a command "docker images"
If ansible installed by pip, sometimes needed to update the path:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/ansible/bin
