Problem with Ansible and Docker integration. 
Observed with Ansible 2.16.24, 2.17.7, 2.18.1.
No sure, if that is a matter of Jenkins's Ansible plugin compatibility:
https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible/

and current for the time being version of Docker (27.5.1, state: 02.02.2025).

Problem is resolved in outdated version of python: 2.9.27 taken from official release repository:

https://releases.ansible.com/ansible/
    To proceed with the ansible-2.9.27.tar.gz package, you'll need to install Ansible from it. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Prerequisites:

    Python: Ansible requires Python. Ensure you have a compatible version installed (preferably Python 3). You can check with python3 --version.
    pip: Python's package manager, pip, is needed. It usually comes with Python installations. Check with pip3 --version.
    System Packages: Depending on your Linux distribution, you might need some system packages. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu systems, you might need build-essential and libssl-dev. Install them using your distribution's package manager (e.g., apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev).

2. Extraction:

    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded ansible-2.9.27.tar.gz.
    Extract the archive using the command: tar -xzf ansible-2.9.27.tar.gz This will create a directory named ansible-2.9.27.

3. Installation:

    Navigate into the extracted directory: cd ansible-2.9.27
    Inside this directory, you'll find Ansible's setup files.
    Install Ansible using pip: pip3 install . (the "." indicates the current directory).

4. Verification:

    After the installation completes, verify it by checking the Ansible version: ansible --version You should see the installed version (2.9.27).

Prerequisities: 
Added ansible repository:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#control-node-requirements

, installed pip3, and docker with pip3. 

Wokirng on Ubuntu 22.04.

In order to check if Ansible works with Docker, prepare test directory, and inside that directory create simple Dockerfile and ansible playbook poniting to this Dockerfile. 
Contents of Dockerfile and playbook in two seperate files. After execution of Ansible playbook, check if image is already created by typing a command "docker images"
If ansible installed by pip, sometimes needed to update the path:
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/ansible/bin
